# Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **global vaccination data** to understand trends in vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and effectiveness. The workflow involves **data cleaning (Python), database management (SQL), and interactive dashboards (Power BI)** to derive actionable insights for **public health strategies, disease prevention, and policy-making**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess vaccination datasets.  
- Store structured data in a **SQL database** with relational integrity.  
- Build **Power BI dashboards** for insights and visualization.  
- Explore vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and vaccine effectiveness.  

---

## 🔑 Business Use Cases  
- **Public Health Strategy** → Assess program effectiveness and prioritize low-coverage areas.  
- **Disease Prevention** → Identify gaps in vaccine efficiency and disease outbreaks.  
- **Resource Allocation** → Forecast vaccine demand and optimize supply chain.  
- **Global Health Policy** → Provide data-driven recommendations for vaccination programs.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The project uses multiple datasets related to vaccination coverage, incidence, and reported cases:  

1. **Coverage Data** – Country, year, antigen, target population, doses, coverage %.  
2. **Incidence Rate** – Disease, year, region, population base, incidence rate.  
3. **Reported Cases** – Country, disease, year, number of reported cases.  
4. **Vaccine Introduction** – Vaccine introduction status per country.  
5. **Vaccine Schedule Data** – Vaccine codes, doses, schedules, target populations.  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations in Power BI  
- **Geographical Heatmaps** → Vaccination coverage & disease incidence by region.  
- **Trend Charts** → Yearly vaccination and disease patterns.  
- **Scatter Plots** → Correlation between vaccination rates and disease incidence.  
- **KPI Indicators** → Progress toward global health targets (e.g., measles 95% by 2030).  

---

## ❓ Example Questions Answered  
- How do vaccination rates correlate with a decrease in disease incidence?  
- What is the drop-off rate between 1st dose and booster doses?  
- Are there regional disparities in vaccination coverage?  
- Which diseases showed the most significant reduction after vaccine introduction?  
- How does population density relate to vaccination coverage?  

---

## ✅ Deliverables  
- **Python Scripts** → For data extraction & cleaning.  
- **SQL Database** → Clean and normalized vaccination + disease data.  
- **Power BI Dashboards** → Interactive insights and reports.  
- **Documentation** → Methodology, challenges, and solutions.  

---

## 📅 Timeline  
- **Day 1-2** → Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- **Day 3-4** → SQL Database Setup & Normalization  
- **Day 5-6** → Power BI Dashboard Development  
- **Day 7** → Documentation & Final Submission
